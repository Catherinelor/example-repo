Project Name: Holiday Cost Calculator

This Python script prompts the user for travel details—destination city, number of hotel nights, and car rental days—and calculates the total holiday cost. It includes predefined flight costs for select cities, a fixed hotel rate (£50/night), and car rental rate (£100/day). If the city isn't listed, the user enters the flight price manually. The final output displays individual costs and the overall total.
